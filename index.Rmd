**Lea Michel, MSc**  
**PhD Student, Cognitive Neuroscience Department, Donders Institute, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen**  

 
I'm a fourth-year PhD student at the Donders Institute in Rogier Kievit group [Lifespan Cognitive Dynamics Lab](https://www.rogierkievit.com/). 
I study the co-development of grey and white matter structure in adolescence.    

I am also interested in how genetics and epigenetic affect the brain, the effect of the environment and particularly abuse on the brain, intergenerational transmission of abuse and mental health.  

My posters and talk slides will be uploaded on [OSF](https://osf.io/ep2dg/). Feel free to contact me for information on any of these projects or for a collaboration. 


Alongside my PhD, I am also invested in reducing the carbon footprint of academia, working both within my department and the Organization for Human Brain Mapping, as the chair of the [SEA-SIG](https://ohbm-environment.org/).
